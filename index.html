<!-- onload = "LoadList()" executes the JavaScript function immediately after the page has been loaded. The default static items (Jello, ...) that were orginially in index.html wouldn't have the dynaimc delete feature of the delete buttons unless I moved them to the script.js file. Now, onload immediately loads the previosuly default static items from the script.js file. This makes them subjected to all the dynamic characteristics that created dynamic items are, like the delete button. -->
